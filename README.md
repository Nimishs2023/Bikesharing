## General Information
- Project for predicting the demand of shared bikes using linear regression
- The business problem being addressed is to accurately predict the demand for shared bikes in different weather conditions and seasons to better allocate the resources and optimize the supply of bikes.

## Conclusions
- The demand for bikes is higher in the summer season, and lower in the winter season.
- Higher temperature and lower humidity result in higher demand for bikes.
- The inclusion of weather features, time-based features, and categorical features in the model improved the accuracy of the predictions.
- The top three features contributing significantly towards explaining the demand for bikes were temperature, humidity, and hour of the day.
